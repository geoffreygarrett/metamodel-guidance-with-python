# Metamodelling for Complex Guidance Problems

Metamodel Guidance with Python, or **mmgpy**, is a library to provide metamodelling (or surrogate modelling)
capabilities of expensive black-box functions for the purpose of guidance optimisation, through the use of machine
learning. It has been developed during my internship at Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse under the supervision of
Kristen Lagadec.
